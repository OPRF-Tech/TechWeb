				<p>There are many reasons why you might want to get your own website online,
				but regardless of the reason, you want it online. We at the OPRF Technology
				Club understand, and are here to help you

				<p>achieve that goal, using only free services. The reason we've written this
				guide is simply so that if our members (or former members) forget how they did 
				it during our 'online setup days' they've got the instructions laid out in 
				front of them.</p>
				
				<div class="lfloat">
					<p><em>Before you get started</em><br />
					You're going to need a few tools:</p>
					
					<ul class="none">
						<li>
							<strong><a href="http://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client">FileZilla</a></strong>
							or another ftp client<br />
							<small>FileZilla is an open source ftp (file transfer protocol) client that
							you can use to move files from your computer to your server.</small>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong><a href="http://jedit.org">jEdit</a></strong> or another text editor<br />
							<small>jEdit is going to be used before you even start the hosting
							process, because you need to make a website before you can host a website.
							If you already have a website made you can ignore this requirement.</small>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>A Website</strong><br />
							<small>While it may seem self-explanatory, but you do need a website before
							you can put a website online.</small>
						</li>
					</ul>

				<p><em>Hosting with
				<a href="http://000webhost.com">000webhost</a></em><br />
				<small>The reason we use 000freehosting is simply because they're <em>free</em>. 
				If you happen to be willing to spend money or want professional hosting, do so. I can
				suggest <a href="http://mediatemple.net">MediaTemple</a> and 
				<a href="http://stuzzhosting.com">StuzzHosting</a> to anyone looking for professional
				hosting.</small></p>

					I'm fairly certain that this is the only new thing.

					The ol tag (for ordered list) is used to make numbered lists. It works exactly
					the same as the ul tag, just with numbers instead.

					<li>
						Go to <a href="http://000webhost.com">000's site</a> and sign up for an 
						account and hosting. It make take a minute or two to be processed and ready 
						to go<br />
						<small>Right now you don't have a domain (unless you set one up separately), 
						so just use one of their second level domains.</small>
					</li>
					<li>
						Once you've been processed, enter your control panel, the important things are all
						either in your head or in the sidebar.<br />Copy the Username (it's 
						<code>a</code> followed by a string of numbers).
					</li>
					<li>
						Open FileZilla if you don't already have it open, and click on the site's icon (the
						first icon in the toolbar). You should see the Site Manager.<br />
						<small>You can come back to this later for other sites you setup too. 
						It also has the ability to change FileZilla settings just for one site.
						</small>
					</li>
					<li>
						<div class="lfloat">
							The <strong>Host</strong> is <em>your site's address</em><br /> 
							Leave the <strong>Port</strong> blank<br />
							The <strong>Server Type</strong> is <em>FTP - File Transfer Protocol</em><br />
							The <strong>Logon Type</strong> is <em>Normal</em><br />
							The <strong>User</strong> is the <em>username you copied earlier</em><br />
							And the <strong>Password</strong> is <em>your chosen password</em>
						</div>
						Click on the "New Site" button.<br />
						<small>The settings are to the left.</small><br />
						After you fill in those settings, go into the Advanced tab, and find the
						<code>Default Remote Directory</code> option, and set it to 
						<code>/publicftp</code>. You're doing this because it will make sure 
						that when you connect to the site, you're in the right remote directory
						(the one which holds the files for your site).
					</li>
					<li>
						Don't close out of the Site Manager, but click Connect down at the bottom. This will
						connect you to your site.<br />
						<small>To connect to your site again, click on the same icon, choose your site, and
						click connect. If you're on windows (I don't know about OSX), you'll have a drop down
						button next to the icon, click it and your site to connect, sorry Linux users.</small>
					</li>
					<li>
						Now navigate to your site, you should see the site you just uploaded (unless you don't
						have your home page named index.html, index.php, index.htm, or default in place of index).
					</li>
