		The reason it isn't included in the index is to cut down on size (even if it's just a

				<!--
					This div uses a class instead of an id. The difference between them
					is simple, a div can only be used once per page, where a class can
					be used as many times as you want on each page (the lfloat class is used
					several times throughout the siteonline file).

								<strong>What does *AMP stand for?</strong><br />
								AMP stands for <em><strong>A</strong>pache</em> (the actual
								server software), <em><strong>M</strong>ySQL</em> (database
								software that's used by many sites and web based programs) and
								<em><strong>P</strong>HP</em> (a programming language for the web).
								The * is used because we don't know what operating system you're
								running, but the options are L (Linux), M (Mac OS X), 
								or W (Windows).
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>What is a stack?</strong><br />
								A stack is a way of describing all of the software together,
								generally people have a LAMP stack, which is all of the software
								described above, just with a fancy word after it.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>What is different about a LAMP a MAMP or a WAMP stack?</strong><br />
								Nothing, other than the operating system they're running on, you
								can run the same software on each stack. Some configuations may
								be different (but those are set by both the user and the software
								being run to host the stack).
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Why would I want a *AMP stack?</strong><br />
								An *AMP server is useful for local development of php/mysql or 
								higher level web development projects. I essentially gives you a 
								server to play with that’s only accessible on your computer, so it’s
								just for you.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>How do I know if it works?</strong><br />
								Open a web browser and head over to 127.0.0.1, if you get any sort 
								of It Works page, you’re golden (though some may have different 
								pages shown)
							</li>
						</ul>

					Everything between this and the end of the normal div is the main content
					for the page, this is the big stuff, the information on setting up a local
					*AMP server.

				<p><em>LAMP - Linux (Debian Baesd)</em><br />
				<small>
					The distribution used by OPRF Tech is Ubuntu, which is based on Debian,
					and has apt-get. Other distributions may use a different program to fetch
					new applications (like yum or pacman), in which case, try substituting 
					apt-get with one of those.
				</small></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Open your terminal and type the following:<br />
						<blockquote><code>
						<!--
							The blockquote tag is used to indent something. The code tag
							is used to specifiy that something is code, in this case, something
							you'd type into a linux terminal (or virtual terminal).

							The blockquote is generally used either for just indenting something
							or an actual quote from someone, if it's used with the code tag, it's
							used to keep the code as a block, instead of inline (you can use
							the cde tag inline with a paragraph if you want).
						-->

							sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 php5-gd mysql-server mysql-client
							php5-mysql libapache2-mod-php5 php5-curl php5-xmlrpc php-pear
						</code></blockquote>
					</li>
					<li>
						Bravo! You've now got a LAMP server installed, your <code>www</code>
						<!--
							So here's one of those nice examples of using the code tag inline.
						-->

						directory (the one that holds all of the files for your local server)
						is located at <code>/var/www</code>. You may want to run another command
						to change the premissions to let you modify files inside of it<br />
						<blockquote><code>
							sudo chmod -R 0777 /var/www
						</code></blockquote>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p><em>MAMP - Mac OS X</em><br />
				<small>
					You need to be running Tiger (10.4.0) or higher to use MAMP. <br />
					<em>MAMP does not load at startup/login</em>
				</small></p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						You'll need to first grab the MAMP app, over at 
						<a href="http://mamp.info">http://mamp.info</a>, and download just
						the standard MAMP (you don't need MAMP Pro, unless you want to pay
						for it).
					</li>
					<li>
						Drag the MAMP.app file out of the DMG and place it in your applications
						directory.
					</li>
					<li>
						Now you need to tweak a few settings, so open up MAMP and head into
						the preferenecs.<br /><br />
						<ul>
							<li>Under the Ports tab, change the Apache port to 80. 80 is the default
							port that web browsers look for when visiting a website.</li>
							<li>Under the Apache tab, change the Document Root to the directory
							that you'll be using to keep the files for your local server. I
							suggest using /users/[your name]/www.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Awesome! You've got the server setup, now just open up MAMP and start
						Apache and MySQL and you're good to go.
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p><em>WAMP - Windows</em><br />
				<small>
					Windows has loads of options, however the easiest (and the one that we're
					going to ues) is called EasyPHP. If you want to, you can install EasyPHP
					on a flash drive and take it with you.<br />
					<em>EasyPHP does not start at startup/login</em>
				</small></p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						You're going to need to nab a copy of EasyPHP. You can get the newest copy 
						through thier website, 
						<a href="http://www.easyphp.org">http://www.easyphp.org</a>, but it doesn't
						work as well as some of the legacy versions. The version I use and suggest 
						you use is 5.3.2i, which can be 
						<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/quickeasyphp/files/EasyPHP/5.3.2i/">
						downloaded from the archives</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						Run the installer, pick whatever directory you want to install it in
						(this is both where you're going to keep your files and where the 
						server files are located), I suggest using C:\Users\[your name]\localhost.
					</li>
