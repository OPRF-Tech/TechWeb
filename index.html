		Okay, first things first, THIS (and by this I mean the text inside of the two brakets on line
		5 and 31) is a comment. That means that the browser doesn't read this, it's just for 
		humans like you and me, so we can see what's going on where.

		You don't need to comment all of your code (especially if you write semantic code), but
		I'm doing so simply so that people can read what's going on with this site.

		Some notes about the code above:
			The <!DOCTYPE html> tag declares that this file is an html document, it's needed to 
			tell the browser that this file is using HTML5 in some cases.

			The <html> tag starts off your page, telling it that what you're writing is in html
			I know, it seems a little redundant after the first line, but the browser wants to see
			it.

			The <head> tag starts off telling the page that you're defining the files header, you're
			adding in all of the nice meta required to make the page look pretty and function well.
			I'll get into that later in the head.

		On another note, these files are going to be slightly larger in size than normal html files
		because they have lots of comments.

		Also, take note of how I use tabs. They're useful for keeping your files nice and readable
		by humans, browsers don't care about how you write the code, just so long as it's written,
		other humans care because they have to read it, so keep your code nice and pretty.

	<title>OPRF Tech | The OPRF HS Technology Club</title>
	<!--
		The <title> tag is used to define the page's title, just like it says. The title is displayed
		at the top of the browser generally (on http://google.com it says "Google", that's because
		the title tag is defined as 'Google').

		Sidenote: You don't have to have the opening and closing comment tag on different lines of 
		the comment, I just do it to add in a little space.
	-->

	<link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Droid+Serif:regular,bold' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' />
	<!-- 
		A <link> is used to link something to your page. In this case, I'm linking a 'stylesheet' (as
		defined in the rel attribute (attributes are the things inside of tags that start attbr=...)),
		and it's file type is a 'text/css' file (as defined by the type attribute). The actual file
		being linked to is defined by the href attribute, in this case the long google webfonts
		address.

		This link is used to add the Droid Serif font to the page (if you look at the style.css file 
		you'll find that Droid Serif is used all over the place). I'll explain why this is linked
		here instead of just defining that the page should be in Droid Serif in the stylesheet 
		(style.css)

		The link tag is a self-closing tag, that means that instead of being <link attributs></link>,
		it just uses <link ... attributes ... /> instead.
	-->

	<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" type="text/css" />
	<!--
		This is another link, some pages have lots of links, some have fewer. This one is used
		to link the stylesheet (written in css, hence the type attribute). Also shown with this
		tag is that it doesn't matter what order your attributes are in (compare the order for this
		one and the previous one), just that they're in there.

<!--
	This is the end of the head, now that all of the required meta data has been added
	to the site, you can start working on the actual appearance of the site itself.

<body>
<!--
	The body tag is used to define the start and end of the body of your page. The body is the meat
	of your page, where all of the content is.
-->
	<div id="container">
	<!--
		A div tag (for divider) is used to define a section of the page, in this case, I'm
		making a div to contain the entire site.

		The id attribute can be used with any tag in the body, but it can only be used once
		per page (so this is the only "container" on the whole page, but there's another container
		on another page).

		The id helps tell the stylesheet that this is the section to style as defined. I'll talk
		more about stylesheets in the stylesheet itself.

		<img src="oprftech.png" alt="OPRF Tech | The OPRF HS Technology Club" id="oprftech" />
		<!--
			An img (for image) tag is used to display an image on the page.

			The src attribute defines the path (either absolute or relative, see below) to the
			image you want to display.

			the alt attribute is used to define alternative text so that if someone is using a
			screen reader, or if the image doesn't load, there's some text for people to get
			a sense of what's supposed to be there.

			A path is the location of a file. A relative path means that you're defining where
			the file is in relation to the current file (so in this case, index.html), an absolute
			path means that you're defining where the file is absolutely.
			
			Example of relative location:
				file.jpg 				file.jpg is in the same directory as the current file
				dir/file.jpg			dir is in the same directory as the current file
			
			Examples of absolute location:
				/file.jpg 						file.jpg is located at http://domain.tld/file.jpg
				http://oprftech.co.cc/file.jpg 	file.jpg is located at http://oprftech.co.cc/file.jpg

		<article>
		<!--
			The article tag is a new-ish tag with HTML5, it's used to define the

			<div id="big">
			<!--
				This is a div used to define the large text seen on the page. To

				This is the closing tag of the <div id="big">, on line 122. It's

			<div id="normal">
			<!--
				This div is used to contain everything else. It's called normal simply

				<p><strong>Our Board:</strong><br />
				<!--
					Another paragraph, but this line has two new things in it, the 
					strong and br tags.

					The strong tag is used to make something bold, or strong.

					The br tag is a self-closing tag used to define a line-break (br
					for break). It's the semantic way to create a new line without
					space after it.
